# KCM
This is KCM. It's an application that's meant to allow a user to look up recipes, store their favorite recipes, and output a shopping list with all of the ingredients from their chosen set recipes. The future of this application will integrate a weekly meal structure, allowing the user to populate every meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) for their respective timeslots for each day of the week.

## Usage
Usage is as simple as signing up or logging in, and searching for meals that you would like to have from the Search for Recipes page. Any meals you add from that page are populated in the My Meals tab, and when you are happy with the selections you've made, you can navigate to the Shopping List page where you can either view the list on your phone, or print it.
